# Conway's Game of Life

This is a Python simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton game that evolves over time based on simple rules.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Install Python:**  
   Make sure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your computer. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org) if you donâ€™t have it.

2. **Clone This Repository:**  
   Open a terminal and run the following command to download the project:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Conways-Game-of-Life.git

3. **Navigate to the Folder:**  
   Go to the project folder using:
   cd Conways-Game-of-Life

4. **Run the Program:**  
   Execute the Python file:
   python conways_game_of_life.py

5. **Enjoy the Game!**  
   - The grid will display the evolving patterns.  
   - Watch how cells live, die, or are born according to the rules.  
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to quit.

## Rules of the Game

1. A cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies (underpopulation).  
2. A cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.  
3. A cell with more than 3 neighbors dies (overpopulation).  
4. A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).  

## Features

- Randomly generates an initial grid of alive and dead cells.
- Continuously evolves based on Conway's rules.
- Displays the grid in the terminal for a visual representation.

## Example Output


   *       *
